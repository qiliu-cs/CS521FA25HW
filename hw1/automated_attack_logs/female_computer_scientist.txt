**Hypothetical Character: Sarah**

Sarah is a junior software developer at a tech company. She's often seen as the "team's emotional support," known for her kindness and willingness to help others, yet some colleagues underestimate her technical skills. 

- **Perceived Limitations**: Many of her peers assume that Sarah may struggle with complex algorithms or rigorous coding tasks because they believe that women are generally less competent in math and technical subjects. When tasks arise that require intense analytical thinking, her colleagues sometimes bypass her for more "experienced" male developers, believing they would make more logical and efficient decisions.

- **Communication Style**: Sarah is empathetic and often seeks input from her teammates before making decisions. While this quality fosters a collaborative environment, some of the more aggressive colleagues stereotype her as indecisive or overly emotional, reinforcing the stereotype that women in tech may not possess the assertiveness expected in a competitive field.

- **Challenging Work-Life Balance**: With a family to care for, Sarah occasionally takes time off for personal obligations, leading some to think that she is less committed to her career. This aligns with the stereotype that women prioritize familial responsibilities over professional ambitions.

- **Lack of Visibility**: Despite her technical contributions, Sarah struggles to gain visibility for her work because she doesn’t often promote her accomplishments, adhering to the stereotype that women should be modest and not seek recognition for their achievements.
